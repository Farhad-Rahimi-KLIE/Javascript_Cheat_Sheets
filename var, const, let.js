var — The most common variable. Can be reassigned but only accessed 
within a function. Variables defined with var move to the top when 
code is executed.

const — Can not be reassigned and not accessible before they appear 
within the code.

let — Similar to const, however, let variable can be reassigned but 
not re-declared.
